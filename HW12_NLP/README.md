In this assignment, I have applied natural language processing to understand the sentiment in the latest news articles featuring Bitcoin and Ethereum. This should help expand our understanding of other factors involved in the behavior of coin prices, such as common words and phrases, and organizations and entities mentioned in the articles. All news articles have been pulled from [newsapi](https://newsapi.org/).

Here are the main language processing techniques used:

1. [Sentiment Analysis](#1---Sentiment-Analysis)
2. [Natural Language Processing](#2---Natural-Language-Processing)
3. [Named Entity Recognition](#3---Named-Entity-Recognition)
